# undefined

- Undefined is also a primitive value in JavaScript. A variable or an object has an undefined value when no value is assigned before using it. So you can say that undefined means lack of value or unknown value. <br/>

- var myVar; <br/>

alert(myVar); // undefined <br/>

# null

- You can assign null to a variable to denote that currently that variable does not have any value but it will have later on. A null means absence of a value. <br/>

- var myVar = null; <br/>

alert(myVar); // null  <br/>
